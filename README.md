# QuantStudio6_DataProcessor
Process data from QuantStudio6 output into relative abundance and fold-change values

Process data from QuantStudio6 output into relative abundance and fold-change values; requires results file from QuantStudio6, "overview" csv as key for data normalization, and "PrimerEfficiency" csv (pre-calculated, not in this code). Doesn't yet handle replicates so need to name uniquely and then merge in post, or adjust code
